This is a simple practice suite to teach you step by step to fork processes,
create a shared memory and use semaphores. I only created this because I'm sure
I would have saved significant time if I completed tasks like these before 
working on my IOS proj2.

I suggest first completing the 'fork' task, then the 'shm' task and finally the
'sem' task. If you are stuck, you can check the next task for hints.

The code is not optimal to prevent simple copy&paste to your project but I
myself am using a similar code in my project, so I trust you won't cause me any
problems :)

For all three tasks there is a makefile. You can use 'make run' command to
compile and run the program.
